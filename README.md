# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Ensuring functionality and security are two different things. Functionality comes down to taking the proper time with the project, testing everything, and
more specifically testing 1 thing at at time. It's a mistake to code everything and test after, this results in a world of pain. Security comes down to understanding
possible vulnerabilities in software, and make sure there aren't any.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I feel that user needs should be taken with a grain of salt, and not at face value. I say this because user needs change, and the software should be
written this this taken into consideration. 

# How do I approach designing software?
I feel like this is an opinion based question, and not necessarily one way is the right way. Some people prefer to design as they go, as certain needs
arise, they update the software accordingly. I personally prefer to prepare for as much as I can, but not over kill it and just update the software overtime.
I feel like investing too much time in design is a mistake, because there's no way to know what the requirements will be in the future, but they will most certainly
change.
